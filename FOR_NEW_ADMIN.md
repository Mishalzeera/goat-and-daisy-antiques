# Hello and Welcome

## Give yourself all Group perms

In the dropdown Admin menu, select Admin Panel.

Here you have a very powerful dashboard that gives you fine control over
all the data that comes in and out of your shop.

Navigate to "Users" under the Authentication and Authorization tab.

Find your username and follow the link.

Scroll down and check that all the Permissions you want are checked.

In **Groups** highlight the groups you wish to add yourself to.

For site wide access, add **Shop Staff**, **Workshop Staff**, **General Staff** and
**Admin Only**.

You must add **Admin Only** at the very least!

## Default Workshop Staff

Firstly, **before anything else** - please ensure that one of your staff members
is set to **"default_workshop_staff"** or the online Workshop will not function.

Its easy to do. Sign in, and under the "Admin" dropdown, select "Staff Management."

This page is where you register new employees as well as view and update their permissions.

Click "View Staff." Locate the staff member you would like as a primary point
of contact with workshop Service Tickets. Click "Manage Permissions" under their
name.

The next page shows a prefilled form and some checkboxes.

**Select** "Default workshop staff", scroll down and **click "Update Staff Profile."**

Now, when customers create a Service Ticket, this staff member will appear as the
primary point of contact.

## How Groups work

When you add a new staff member, they will have General Staff permission by default.

This gives them access to:

- All customers info and profile details
- Some customer account update features
- a personal Task Manager

However, their specific permissions for their role must be set by you.

You do this either at the time of creating their profile or updating it
in the same screen you set default_workshop_staff.

Navigate to Admin dropdown, then Staff Management, View Staff and then
Manage Permissions for the individual staff member.

People with Shop Staff permissions can:

- view Shop orders, where they can check if an order has been shipped or not, and
  manage the "completed" status of an order.
- manage inventory, where they can add new items and images as well as update them
  and their availability.

The other items in their dropdown are the shared General Staff tools we mentioned
earlier.

People with Workshop Staff permissions can:

- view Customers and Tickets, where they can see what tickets need to be done,
  check the links the customer has provided for the correct materials, look at images
  and update notes etc for tickets.

- manage Invoices, which begins with staff reviewing the Ticket and giving a quote.
  The invoices are then automatically added to the customers Invoice portal.

Again, the other items are the general items we mentioned earlier.

People with Admin Only permissions can:

- add, update and manage staff details
- issue and update tasks for individual staff
- view all active task lists in the company

## The Admin Task Manager

- here you can issue specific tasks to employees by selecting their name
  from the dropdown menu and creating a list title, then list items

- follow the links to update them, its pretty straighforward

- employees can read and mark the items done, but they don't have any delete control

### The Task Overview

- this is for admin to keep an eye on all the tasks in the company and their
  status.
