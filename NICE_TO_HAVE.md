## Task Manager:

First, to refactor it into a reusable app.

At the moment it is read-only for admin, which is somewhat invasive as well
as limiting for admin.

A good feature for the future would be admin-issued tasks via
the admin task panel, allowing admin to only see the status of
admin issued tasks.

## Workshop Staff and Customer CRUD over Service Tickets:

Would be good to discuss with a real business owner what would be the best
way to limit both sides in terms of modifying existing tickets. On the
one hand, the customer should be able to easily add information when they
need to. On the other hand, neither side should be able to unfairly
manipulate a Ticket so that the other side is at a disadvantage.
