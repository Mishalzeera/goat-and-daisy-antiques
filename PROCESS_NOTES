## Heroku deployment

-Deploy early with minimal apps and views. 
-Ensure secret key is set as an env variable in a os.path.exists("env.py") file.
-Use the code snippet from Heroku to create a separate staticfiles dir that 
-Heroku can use to copy files to.
-Install whitenoise to allow Heroku to directly serve your static files at least
during production.


## Using built in Django Auth module

-Make sure the template path in settings is added to the project level, and 
create a templates>registration>login.html for login etc. Log out is called
logged_out.html.
