## Introduction and basic features

An online antique store that provides restoral and repair services,
built using Django. The store uses custom CMS for seperate sales and repair
departments. A user who wishes to buy does not need to create an account, but
can if she so wishes. A user who wishes to have repairs or restorals done, on
the other hand, must create an account in order to keep track of their specific
requests, materials etc.

## The User(s)

### The Customer

The customer can browse the shop and buy items without creating an account
or logging in. Creating an account allows the customers shipping information
to be stored, otherwise there isn't much of a significant benefit as a shop
customer.

As a workshop customer, however, creating an account is essential. This allows
a customer to access a 'workbench' where they can create service tickets, add
images for many reasons, links to materials etc.

### The Staff Member

The small staff at G&D are split into two camps. Those to do
with the shop and those to do with the repairs and restorals. They have limited
permissions to interact with the site functionality depending on their roles.

## The Shop

A small online store that sells antique furniture and curiousities. The small
size of the inventory makes it more of a boutique. Customers can buy things
without creating an account. Creating an account allows the customer to save
delivery information etc.

## The Workshop

The workshop is designed for close collaboration with the staff and customers.
There is also a mutual accountability between staff and customers. Customers
are obligated to create an account, which allows the staff to refer to
style guides that the customer supplies. The idea is not to replace
an in-person experience, but to provide the customer with a more interactive
collaboration and have more peace of mind.
