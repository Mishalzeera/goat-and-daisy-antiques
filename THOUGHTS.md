## Because more docs is better docs

For one, I am glad I chose to use the Django Auth and the built in
CBVs etc. While I can see how much better Django Rest Framework and
AllAuth are, the insight into Django's inner workings was worth the
challenging experience of learning OOP this way.

Bootstrap was a big help. While I am glad I chose to learn as much
raw css as I could, it was so helpful to have Bootstrap just throw
the design together. Having an idea of what is going on in the background
made it a lot easier to override and troubleshoot things.

While Django has been a pretty impressive experience from the inside,
seeing the hard work of really well thought development - my appreciation
for Flask has also grown. If its not something huge you want, but a little
bit of backend processing, its perfect.
