## Task Manager:

Refactor it into a reusable app.

## Workshop Staff and Customer CRUD over Service Tickets:

Would be good to discuss with a real business owner what would be the best
way to limit both sides in terms of modifying existing tickets. On the
one hand, the customer should be able to easily add information when they
need to. On the other hand, neither side should be able to unfairly
manipulate a Ticket so that the other side is at a disadvantage.

## Shopping manager for workshop staff

Some kind of setup that would allow workshop staff to keep track of
their acquisitions for Service Tickets.
